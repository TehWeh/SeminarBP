\section{Conclusion}
The two message passing algorithms described in section are able to solve SAT problems and even to compute assignments and some other parameters of a formula if its factor graph is a tree. For general graphs both algorithms may not converge and may even yield wrong ansers. There is not much known about what conditions a graph must fulfill to assure convergence of the passed messages. \newline
Even though both algorithms empirically converge rather often and are even used in praxis there better techniques based to the general sum-product algorithm. In \cite{survprob} a variant called \emph{survey propagation} is presented which is tied to methods used in statistical physics. On trees this new method behaves like BP but on experiments on random graphs it performs better than standard belief propagation.
