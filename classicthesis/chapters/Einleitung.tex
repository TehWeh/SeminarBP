\chapter{Einleitung}

As many common problems naturally reduce to finding solutions of boolean formulas, SAT solvers are frequently used in practice and there is a need for finding fast and precise algorithms.  
The main part of this seminar thesis is Section \ref{BPFS} where two probabilistic methods for heuristically finding assignments of satisfiable SAT formulas are described. These methods are called \emph{Warning Propagation} and \emph{Belief Propagation}. Both are so called \emph{Message Passing} algorithms which are explained in section \ref{FGMP}.

The belief propagation algorithm is a general method for probabilistic inference problems and was proposed by Judea Pearl in 1982. The generic algorithm can be applied in many different contexts like coding theory or image processing. In the context of SAT it works by approximating marginal probabilities of the formula's solutions.

A belief propagation approach was used in the SAT solver "Dimetheus", which won gold medals in 2014 and 2016 in the international SAT competition (see \cite{satcomp}) for efficiently solving randomly generated satisfiable instances.
